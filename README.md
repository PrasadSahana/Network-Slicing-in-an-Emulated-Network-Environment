## Network Slicing in an Emulated Network Environment

#### 5G is visualized to be a network that can support multi-service networks with a a wide range of different set of performance having service requirements. Network slicing is a very diverse part of 5G and implementing this technique on a a single physical network into multiple logical networks has become a key to realizing this long-term goal. This project is meant to focus on the topic of network slicing as primary set of concepts. We begin by implementing the VoIP services in 5G network slicing and present a topology for successful implementation in a holistic manner using GRE tunneling.
